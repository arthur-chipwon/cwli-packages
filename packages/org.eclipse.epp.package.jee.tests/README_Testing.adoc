= Testing the Enterprise Java and Web package

Running manual tests is very expensive. The test cases below should be considered for automation!

NOTE: TODO: Automate tests

Any failure to those test cases should be reported to the Eclipse.org project causing the error, and to the link:https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/epp-dev[EPP mailing-list].

There is room for improvement in these test cases (more test cases, more detailed steps). Feel free to contribute!


== How to test the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers package


. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/J2EE_Smoke_Tests[J2EE Smoke Tests]

. Next, perform manual checks of general layout, preferences.

. Finally, check for changes from integrated features like m2e, oomph, etc.

Note: TODO: add more details here!
